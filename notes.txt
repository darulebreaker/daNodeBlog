this.models w/ an "s"
$('#snippetViewTemplate')  w/ a #

this.$el is undefined --- the event aggregator was not correct    should be 

         "_.bindAll(this,"createNew");
        options.vent.bind('createNew',this.createNew);" 
	and createNew would call this.render so the scope is correct

       you had   "  options.vent.bind('createNew',this.render);"
